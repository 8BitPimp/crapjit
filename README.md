#### The terrible JIT compiler

Crapjit is a weekend project I worked on whenever I wasnt playing Fallout4.

Crapjit is my proof of concept for a really sucky JIT compiler implementation.
It takes its name from the terrible code it produces; far worse then unoptimised, however it makes up for this (a little) in simplicity and ease of implementation.
